# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Intelligent Git Workflow Assistant is an AI-powered tool that leverages open-source GPT models to provide intelligent, context-aware Git workflow assistance. It goes beyond simple command suggestions by understanding code changes, project context, and developer intent to provide personalized Git guidance. The assistant uses natural language processing to interpret developer goals and translates them into appropriate Git operations, making Git more accessible and efficient for developers of all skill levels.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to describe my Git goals in natural language and have the AI assistant translate them into appropriate Git commands, so that I can work intuitively without memorizing complex syntax.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer types a natural language request like "I want to undo my last commit but keep the changes" THEN the system SHALL interpret the intent and suggest the appropriate Git command with explanation
2. WHEN the developer asks "How do I merge my feature branch safely?" THEN the system SHALL analyze the repository state and provide personalized step-by-step guidance
3. WHEN the developer describes a complex scenario THEN the system SHALL break it down into a sequence of Git operations with rationale
4. WHEN the suggested command could be destructive THEN the system SHALL explain the risks and offer safer alternatives

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated Git workflow suggestions based on my project's branching strategy, so that I can follow consistent practices without manual planning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system detects a Git repository THEN it SHALL identify the branching strategy (GitFlow, GitHub Flow, etc.)
2. WHEN starting new work THEN the system SHALL suggest appropriate branch creation commands based on the detected workflow
3. WHEN completing a feature THEN the system SHALL recommend the correct merge/rebase strategy for the project
4. IF the repository uses conventional commits THEN the system SHALL suggest properly formatted commit messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the assistant to help prevent common Git mistakes, so that I can avoid losing work or creating problematic repository states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN attempting to commit to main/master branch directly THEN the system SHALL warn and suggest creating a feature branch
2. WHEN there are large files or sensitive data in staging THEN the system SHALL alert before committing
3. WHEN attempting destructive operations THEN the system SHALL require confirmation and explain consequences
4. WHEN the working directory is dirty before switching branches THEN the system SHALL suggest stashing or committing changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want AI-generated commit messages that understand the semantic meaning of my code changes, so that my commit history tells a clear story of the development process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN staging changes for commit THEN the system SHALL analyze the code diff using AI to understand the functional impact and generate meaningful commit messages
2. WHEN the AI detects refactoring, bug fixes, or new features THEN it SHALL categorize the changes and suggest appropriate conventional commit formats
3. WHEN changes are complex THEN the system SHALL generate detailed commit messages that explain both what changed and why
4. WHEN multiple logical changes exist THEN the system SHALL suggest splitting into focused commits with individual AI-generated messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated branch management assistance, so that I can keep my repository clean and organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN branches are merged THEN the system SHALL suggest cleaning up local and remote tracking branches
2. WHEN working with multiple remotes THEN the system SHALL help manage upstream relationships
3. WHEN branches become stale THEN the system SHALL identify and suggest cleanup actions
4. WHEN creating new branches THEN the system SHALL suggest naming conventions based on project patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want AI-powered pull request assistance that understands my code changes and generates comprehensive PR descriptions, so that code reviews are more effective and informative.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a pull request THEN the system SHALL analyze all commits and code changes to generate a comprehensive PR description explaining the purpose, changes, and impact
2. WHEN the AI detects breaking changes or significant architectural modifications THEN it SHALL highlight these in the PR description with appropriate warnings
3. WHEN reviewing code changes THEN the system SHALL suggest relevant reviewers based on code ownership patterns and expertise areas
4. WHEN PR conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL provide AI-guided resolution suggestions with explanations of the implications
